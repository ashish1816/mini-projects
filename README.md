       Summary:-
             An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software       
             components, operating systems, or microservices. I have used api calls from "joeschmoe.io" which returns an avatar based on my user name.
             
        More about Joe Schmoe:-
             Joe Schmoes are colorful characters illustrated by Jon&Jess that can be used as profile picture placeholders for live websites or design mock ups. The 
             big advantage of our API is that when you request the same Schmoe multiple times, you'll get the same avatar each time—perfect for when you're 
             associating an image with a user's identity. Use your user’s name, email or ID to keep their avatar consistent and unique throughout the user 
             experience.
